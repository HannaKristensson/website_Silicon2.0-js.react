# Silicon website 2.0 With JavaScript and React
Expansion of an erlier poject, the Silicon website, wich was a project for my .net education on EC. 
The project this time was to convert the previous website into React with JSX components. 

It needed to:
-  be built in React and devided into different component-sections.
-  have a second page called contact, based out of a figma file deisgn. We only got the design for desktop-mode and had to create our own take for the mobile- and tabletmode.
-  be possible to navigate back and forth from homepage to contact-page.
-  have a mobile- and tablet compatible menu, by own design.
-  have forms with working validations with regular expressions, that could send the data to web API and confirm for user if it was accompished or not. 
-  get Testimonals and FAQ from web API and show it on the website in the way it was showed in the designfile.
-  be able to change from light- to darkmode with the togglerswitch.
-  have useState, useEffect and useContext in appropriate places in the code.
